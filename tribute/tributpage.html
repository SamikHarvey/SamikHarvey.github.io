    When his grandmother passed away a few years ago, YoungBoy was left to fend for himself. He dropped out of school in the 9th grade and, shortly after, was arrested for robbery. “I had been rapping, but I used to hide that shit,” he remembers. “I was scared, not for sure ‘bout myself, playing with my craft.” During his six-month sentence in a juvenile detention center in Tallulah, Louisiana, he wrote song after song for what would later become his first mixtape, Life Before Fame, released in 2015.

 Where YoungBoy Never Broke Again finds oxygen is in his music — he is 17, and already one of the most promising young Southern rappers of the past couple of years, an intuitive songwriter who salts his bravado with inward-looking seriousness.“AI YoungBoy,” his latest mixtape, which he released this month, is his best so far. It comes just three months after he was released from prison having pleaded guilty to aggravated assault with a firearm, dodging attempted murder charges.
